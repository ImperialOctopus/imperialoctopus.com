[Fake Artist Companion App](https://fake-artist.imperialoctopus.com/)

A web app to replace the gamemaster when playing A Fake Artist Goes to New York.

## Instructions

1. Enter the number of players on the first screen and press play.
2. Each player privately selects their number and views the prompt word.
3. One player is secretly chosen as "Fake" so does not know the prompt word.
4. Players take it in turn to add to a drawing until each player has drawn two times.
5. All players vote on who the fake was.
6. If the fake is not chosen correctly they win.
7. If the fake is chosen correctly but they guess the prompt word the fake wins, otherwise the other players win.
