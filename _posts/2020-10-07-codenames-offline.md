I recently challenged myself to create a digital recreation of the board game Codenames in time for a board games society event at our college. This is the result!

It's got a full list of words from boardgamegeek.com and a rotatable secret spymaster view for a second device.

## Description

Digital version of the board game Codenames designed to be played in person with a tablet and phone. The main game with cards should be put on the table in front of players, and the spymasters should view the secret board layout on their phones.
