[Lilac RTS Web App](https://apps.imperialoctopus.com/lilac)

Unit micro-management mechanics from the RTS genre applied to a multi-platform action/puzzle game.
Players use the ability to slow down time to outmanoeuvre increasingly difficult AI opponents.

Time controls in the bottom left of the screen let you slow down or speed up time to avoid projectiles.  
Click and drag to select a box of units.  
Right click to order selected units to move.  
CTRL + click or middle click to order units to fire.
