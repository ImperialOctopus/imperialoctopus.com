I've always loved collectible card games but have (like many people) long been frustrated by how expensive they can be! Even for a casual player who has no interest in buying up sought-after competitive cards, a game like Magic: The Gathering can cost hundreds of pounds if you want to play with more than just a couple of decks.

Development costs are obviously high considering the beautiful art and rigorous playtesting - so the obvious solution was to make a card game with neither! Hexal can be printed at home for nothing more than the cost of paper and ink. The [online deck builder](https://hexal.imperialoctopus.com/) allows you to view the full card library and only print out copies of cards as you need them to build your decks to save on time and paper.

I opted to print out a copy of the library on thicker card, and buy some cheap plastic sleeves for them as I love sitting at a table and going through piles of cards to put together a deck but the game is fully functional with as few as 7 sheets of paper for a 2 player game.

## Game Description

A completely free collectible card game you can print and play at home.

Hexal is a two-player game that represents a battle between witches. Players channel the power of nature to summon creatures and cast spells. When one player runs out of cards (representing their magical power) the battle is over.
