[Avalon Companion Web App](https://avalon.imperialoctopus.com/)

While the setup dialog for Avalon is far simpler than for some other games (One Night Ultimate Werewolf comes to mind!) we thought it was a shame there was no similar app to read out the lines for you.

This might be useful for new players who have yet to remember all the lines - but is really intended to be a bit of fun rather than anything useful!

Human announcer voiced by [Cathy Wooller](https://github.com/AdrenalinJunkie).

## Instructions

1. Use the button in the bottom left to select the number of players.
2. Select the desired roles.
3. Distribute and privately view role cards.
4. Press play to begin narration.
