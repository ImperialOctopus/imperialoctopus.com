[Formul8 Web App](https://apps.imperialoctopus.com/formul8/)

This app was developed for Vivianne Child at Child Associates.

Formul8 is an app to help you organise your priorities in life. Clients select two "key factors" to rate their commitments on. A coordinator can use the resulting table and pie chart to help work through which commitments get them closer to achieving their goals and which might not be as productive.
