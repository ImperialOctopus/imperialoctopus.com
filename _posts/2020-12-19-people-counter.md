I developed this app for the charity Tring Together to help them count people entering the high street during their Christmas Festival (mid-Covid 19 pandemic) to keep numbers within a safe limit. It uses Google's Firebase for backend so doesn't require any dedicated server hosting and can be built as an Android app for submission to the Play Store.
