						<p>Change Management That Works</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						Welcome to the website of Child Associates. We are very enthusiastic about change; after all, if
						we are changing something for the better, then the quicker it happens the better. Change,
						whether it is at work or home, provides opportunities for tomorrow. We help organisations look
						forward to change by offering:
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="#coaching">Business coaching</a> “a well-structured series of conversations between a
						professional coach and a
						client, with the intent of guiding the client towards a more fulfilled and positively enhanced
						business life.”<br />

					<p>
						Child Associates is led by <a href="#about">Vivianne Child</a>, using other professional coaches
						and facilitators where needed. The business has over 15 years’ experience using techniques that
						are common sense, but not common practice. We think work should be fun!

						<h3>Coaching</h3>
						<p>User-Friendly Business Coaching</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						Our definition of coaching is “a well-structured series of conversations between a
						professional coach and a client, with the intent of guiding the client towards a
						more fulfilled and positively enhanced business life.” You have all the solutions
						to your business challenges within your grasp. Coaching gives you the space
						and the support to find the right answers to your business questions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here are just a few of the common challenges that people bring to the
						coaching table, but whatever you want to work on, you will find an active
						listening ear.
					</p>

					</ul>
					<p>
						Be bold and just <a href="#contact">get in touch</a> to talk about why you are thinking of
						working with a business coach. We offer a (free) introductory chat to talk about you –
						you have nothing to lose and lots to gain.

						<h3>Team Development</h3>
						<p>Build a Top Performing Team</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						Luckily, there’s always a good excuse to do some top-quality team work. Perhaps these
						objectives for some team-work resonate with you?
					</p>
					<div style="color: red">
						<ul>
							<li>Team goal & priority setting</li>
							<li>Establish team values & protocols</li>
							<li>Kick-start energy levels in established teams</li>
							<li>Improve underperforming teams</li>
							<li>Team induction for new members</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>
						As facilitators, we design, organise and facilitate team awaydays, strategy and budget
						planning meetings to achieve <strong>your</strong> agreed outcome.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Our experience has identified the benefits of using an external facilitator:</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It’s hard for the team leader to lead the day and play a full part in the debate. With
							our help, you can properly take part and enjoy the day.</li>
						<li>A facilitator adds structure and rigour to an event, ensuring you meet all your
							objectives.</li>
						<li>Using a facilitator says to your team that you take team development seriously.</li>
